**Data**: Facts and statistics collected together for reference or analysis.

**Data Analysis**: The process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.

**Data Analytics**
The science of data.The techniques and processes of data analytics have been automated into mechanical processes and algorithms that work over raw data for human consumption.

**Data Analyst**: A person who collects, organizes, and analyzes data, and then using the data to effectively tell a story.

**Data Analysis Life Cycle**:
The six steps of the data analysis process are:

  1. **Ask**:
  Define the problem you want to solve and the questions you want to answer. This involves understanding the business problem, identifying the data sources you need, and defining the scope of the analysis.

  2. **Prepare**:
    Collect the data you need to answer your questions. This involves identifying the relevant data sources, gathering the data, and ensuring that the data is accurate and complete.

  3. **Process**:
    Prepare the data for analysis. This involves cleaning the data, transforming it into a usable format, and dealing with missing or incomplete data.

  4. **Analyze**:
    Analyze the data to answer your questions. This involves using statistical and machine learning techniques to identify patterns, trends, and relationships in the data.

  5. **Share**:
    Visualize the results of your analysis. This involves creating charts, graphs, and other visualizations to help communicate your findings.

  6. **Act**:
    Make decisions based on your analysis. This involves using the insights you have gained from your analysis to inform business decisions and drive action.

**Control of the Data**:
Businesses need a way to control all the data so they can use it to:
