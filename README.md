### Learning Log

**Data**: Facts and statistics collected together for reference or analysis.

**Data Analysis**: The process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.

**Data Analytics**
The science of data.The techniques and processes of data analytics have been automated into mechanical processes and algorithms that work over raw data for human consumption.

**Data Analyst**: A person who collects, organizes, and analyzes data, and then using the data to effectively tell a story.

**Data Analysis Life Cycle**:
The six steps of the data analysis process are:

  1. **Ask**:
  Define the problem you want to solve and the questions you want to answer. This involves understanding the business problem, identifying the data sources you need, and defining the scope of the analysis.

  2. **Prepare**:
    Collect the data you need to answer your questions. This involves identifying the relevant data sources, gathering the data, and ensuring that the data is accurate and complete.

  3. **Process**:
    Prepare the data for analysis. This involves cleaning the data, transforming it into a usable format, and dealing with missing or incomplete data.

  4. **Analyze**:
    Analyze the data to answer your questions. This involves using statistical and machine learning techniques to identify patterns, trends, and relationships in the data.

  5. **Share**:
    Visualize the results of your analysis. This involves creating charts, graphs, and other visualizations to help communicate your findings.

  6. **Act**:
    Make decisions based on your analysis. This involves using the insights you have gained from your analysis to inform business decisions and drive action.

**Control of the Data**:
Businesses need a way to control all the data so they can use it to:

  1. **Improve Processes**:
  Data can be used to identify inefficiencies and improve processes. For example, a business might use data to identify bottlenecks in their supply chain and find ways to improve the flow of goods.

  2. **Identify Opportunities and Trends**:
  Data can be used to identify opportunities and trends. For example, a business might use data to identify new markets for their products or services.

  3. **Launch New Products**:
  Data can be used to launch new products. For example, a business might use data to identify customer needs and develop new products to meet those needs.

  4. **Serve Customers**:
  Data can be used to serve customers. For example, a business might use data to identify customer needs and develop new products to meet those needs.

  5. **Make Thoughtful Decisions**:
  Data can be used to make thoughtful decisions. To be on top of their competition, businesses need to make decisions based on data, not just intuition.

**Data Science**:
Creating a new ways of modeling and understanding the unknown by using raw data. Data Science is a field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured, similar to data mining. Data Science is composed by three main areas:

  1. **Analytics**
  2. **Statistics**
  3. **Machine Learning**

**Data Ecosystem**:
The collection of tools and technologies that are used to collect, store, process, analyze, and visualize data.

**Cloud**:
A network of remote servers hosted on the Internet that are used to store, manage, and process data. Cloud computing is a model for delivering computing services over the Internet.

**Data-Driven Decision Making**:
The process of making decisions based on data. Data-driven decision making is a process that involves collecting data, analyzing it, and using it to inform business decisions.

**Data Engineering**:
The practice of processing data for an enterprise. Data engineering is a set of operations aimed at creating interfaces and mechanisms for the flow and access of information. It is a broad field that encompasses many tools and techniques related to data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).
